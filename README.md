# Ecommerce_SQL
This project analyzes an e-commerce transaction dataset using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The dataset contains user purchases across different product categories, including pricing, discounts, payment methods, and purchase dates.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate strong SQL querying skills by performing data exploration, aggregation, joining, and performance optimization on real-world structured data.
In this project, the following SQL techniques were implemented:

✅ Data Retrieval & Filtering using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY

✅ Data Aggregation using GROUP BY, SUM(), and AVG()

✅ Joins including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN

✅ Subqueries for advanced customer and revenue analysis

✅ Date Transformation for monthly revenue trends

✅ Views created for reusable analytical summaries

✅ Indexing to optimize query performance

✅ PostgreSQL-compatible functions (TO_DATE, TO_CHAR)
